# Dirty Boy

Unity editor utility to manage dirty status of assets

Adds a "Mark Dirty" context option to Unity. Use it to update assets after modifying their fields in code.
Right click on any asset or GameObject and select "Mark Dirty" from the context menu.

Saving the project after marking as object dirty will cause Unity to reserialize it.
